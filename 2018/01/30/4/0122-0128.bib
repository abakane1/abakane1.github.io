abstract = {The terms Internet of Things and Big Data are currently subject to much attention, though the specific impact of these terms in our practical lives are difficult to apprehend. Data-driven approaches do lead to new possibilities, and significant improvements within a broad range of domains can be achieved through a cloud-based infrastructure. In the agricultural sector, data-driven precision agriculture shows great potential in facilitating the increase in food production demanded by the increasing world population. However, the adoption rate of precision agriculture technology has been slow, and information and communications technology needed to promote the implementation of precision agriculture is limited by proprietary integrations and non-standardized data formats and connections. In this paper, an open geospatial data infrastructure is presented, based on standards defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The emphasis in the design was on improved interoperability, with the capability of using sensors, performing cloud processing, carrying out regional statistics, and provide seamless connectivity to machine terminals. The infrastructure was implemented through open source software, and was complemented by open data from governmental offices along with ESA satellite imagery. Four use cases are presented, covering analysis of nearly 50 000 crop fields and providing seamless interaction with an emulated machine terminal. They act to showcase both for how the infrastructure enables modularity and interoperability, and for the new possibilities which arise from this new approach to data within the agricultural domain.},

abstract = {Weed detection is still a challenging problem for robotic weed removal. Small tolerance between the cutting tine and main crop position requires highly precise discrimination of the weed against the main crop. Close similarities between the shape features of sugar beet and common weeds make it impossible to define an exclusive feature to be able to efficiently detect all the weeds with acceptable accuracy. Therefore in this study, it was tried to integrate several shape features to establish a pattern for each variety of the plants. To enable the vision system in the detection of the weeds based on their pattern, support vector machine and artificial neural networks were employed. Four species of common weeds in sugar beet fields were studied. Shape feature sets included Fourier descriptors and moment invariant features. Results showed that the overall classification accuracy of ANN was 92.92{\%}, where 92.50{\%} of weeds were correctly classified. Higher accuracies were obtained when the SVM was used as the classifier with an overall accuracy of 95.00{\%} whereas 93.33{\%} of weeds were correctly classified. Also, 93.33{\%} and 96.67{\%} of sugar beet plants were correctly classified by ANN and SVM respectively.},

@article{Lu2017,
abstract = {A wide variety of predictive analytics techniques have been developed in statistics, machine learning and data mining; however, many of these algorithms take a black-box approach in which data is input and future predictions are output with no insight into what goes on during the process. Unfortunately, such a closed system approach often leaves little room for injecting domain expertise and can result in frustration from analysts when results seem spurious or confusing. In order to allow for more human-centric approaches, the visualization community has begun developing methods to enable users to incorporate expert knowledge into the prediction process at all stages, including data cleaning, feature selection, model building and model validation. This paper surveys current progress and trends in predictive visual analytics, identifies the common framework in which predictive visual analytics systems operate, and develops a summarization of the predictive analytics workflow.},

abstract = {Urban computing is a process of acquisition, integration and analysis of big and heterogeneous data generated by a diver-sity of sources in urban spaces, such as sensors, devices, ve-hicles, buildings and humans, to tackle the major issues that cities face, e.g., air pollution, energy consumption and traffic congestion. Urban computing connects unobtrusive and ubiq-uitous sensing technologies, advanced data management and analytics models, and novel visualization methods, to cre-ate win-win-win solutions that improve urban environment, human life quality, and city operation systems. Urban com-puting also helps us understand the nature of urban phenom-ena and even predict the future of cities. Urban computing is an interdisciplinary field fusing computer science and in-formation technology with traditional city-related fields, like urban planning, transportation, civil engineering, economy, ecology, and sociology, in the context of urban spaces [1]. 1) Figure 1 presents a general framework of urban comput-ing which is comprised of four layers: urban sensing, ur-ban data management, urban data analytics, and service pro-viding. The following paragraphs discuss main challenges of each layer and key techniques needed. • Urban sensing collects data from different sources through sensors or humans in a city. There are two main urban sensing modes, consisting of sensor-centric sensing and human-centric sensing. The former mode deploys a collection of sensors in fixed locations, e.g., at meteorological stations, or with moving objects, such Fig. 1 A general framework of urban computing [1] as buses or taxies. Those sensors continuously send readings to a backend system without involving people in the loop, once they have been deployed. The human-centric sensing mode leverages humans as sensors to probe urban dynamics when they are moving around in cities. The information collected by individuals is then used to solve a problem collectively. The challenges of urban sensing are four-fold: 1) skewed sample data, 2) data sparsity and missing, 3) implicit and noisy data, 1) For the reader's convenience, this paragraph is directly extracted from Ref. [1] to keep the definition consistent 2 Front. Comput. Sci., 2017, 11(1): 1–3 and 4) resource deployment [2]. • The urban data management layer manages large-scale and dynamic urban data, which is usually as-sociated with a spatial coordinate and a timestamp (i.e., spatio-temporal properties), using cloud comput-ing platforms, indexing structures, and retrieval algo-rithms. Current cloud computing platforms cannot sup-port spatio-temporal data very well for three reasons: 1) the data structure of spatio-temporal data, e.g., tra-jectory data [3], is very different from texts and im-ages; 2) Queries on spaito-temporal data, e.g., find-ing a vacant taxi around me in the past two minutes, are different from key words matches; 3) Because an urban computing application needs to simultaneously consume multiple datasets from different domains, we need to organize different datasets organically and in advance. However, the three techniques are missing on current cloud computing platforms. To address these issues, this layer first devises different storage mech-anisms on the cloud for different types of urban data. Second, this layer designs unique indexing structures and retrieval algorithms for spatial and spatio-temporal data as well as hybrid indexing structures for organiz-ing multi-modality data across different domains [4]. Those indexing and retrieval techniques are founda-tions of upper-level data mining and machine learn-ing tasks. Third, this layer enables some advanced data management functions, such as map-matching, finding the Maximum K-coverage setand dynamic dispatching, which can solve many urban computing problems by themselves. • The urban data analytics layer applies a diversity of data mining models and machine learning algorithms to unlock the power of knowledge from data across different domains. This layer adapts basic data min-ing and machine learning models, such as clustering, classification, regression and anomaly detection algo-rithms, to handling spatio-temporal data's unique prop-erties, consisting of spatial distance, spatial hierarchy, temporal closeness, period and trend. This layer also fuses the knowledge from multiple disparate datasets based on cross-domain data fusion methods [5], such as the Deep Learning-based [6], multi-view-based, proba-bilistic dependency-based, similarity-based and transfer learning-based data fusion. As many urban computing applications need instantaneous services, it is also im-portant to combine database techniques with machine learning algorithms in a data mining task. Based on the aforementioned components, advanced topics on this layer include filling missing values in spatio-temporal data, predictive models, object profiling, and causality inference. • The service providing layer offers interface that al-lows domain systems to call the knowledge from an urban computing application, through cloud computing platforms. As urban computing is an inter-disciplinary field, the knowledge from data must be integrated into existing domain systems to inform their decision mak-ing. In addition, it is imperative to enable interactive vi-sual data analytics [7], which combine human wisdom with machine intelligence by keeping domain experts in a learning loop. In terms of the timing that a ser-vice is created for, this layer provides three categories of services, consisting of understanding current situa-tion, predicting future, and diagnosing history. For in-stance, inferring the real-time and fine-grained air qual-ity throughout a city based on big data belongs to the first category [8], while forecasting air quality over fu-ture time is an example of the second category [9]; di-agnosing the root cause of air pollution based on data accumulated over a long period belongs to the last cate-gory. Based on the domain that a service is created for, the services provided by this layer range from trans-portation to environmental protection, to urban plan-ning, energy saving, social and entertainment, and pub-lic security.},
